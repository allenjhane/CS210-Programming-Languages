# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This upload is Project 2 from the CS 210 - Programming Languages class at Southern New Hampshire University. This project calculates a users investment over a given amount of years with compound interest. This program will take user given data (initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and number of years) and output data on their investment over the given years (with and without a monthly deposit).

# What did you do particularly well?
When I first created this project, I had some road bumps, but I overcame them in the end. I particularly did well in understanding implementing pointers in the project. Incorporating pointers were a roadblack I encountered throughout the project.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I believe I can enhance my code by refactoring more of the logic I created. I used the template given but I believe I could have refactored the program based on the template. I also believe that I could have used some of the logic I created in Java instead for security measures for the data that the user gave for the investment account. Though a simple investment calculator program may not need much security, in a broader aspect it will be important when the user gives more confidential data.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part to write was the use of pointers in the program. In order to overcome this, I did research on the use of pointers and its best practices in C++. Some tools/resources I used were W3schools and GeeksForGeeks for C++ pointer information, and Stack Overflow for understanding the errors I encourtered while programming. I will continue to use these reseources as I further my education in school and in industry, especially Stack Overflow to understand why I encounter certain problems.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Transferable skills from this project are the use of pointers and commenting. Pointers were particularly hard to understand for me but I made sure to understand how to use them. This is because I know that it will be useful when I have to work with registers and linked lists in other languages. Commenting isn't particularly hard to code, but it is hard to make good comments, in my opinion. In this project, I became better at writing comments to make myself understand my use of pointers. In turn, I believe in my descriptive comments it was easier for me to understand each part of the project I coded, especially with aspects I just learned.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
In order to make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I wrote as many descriptive comments necessary to understand each aspect of the project. I think this will help others who read my code able to maintain and read each part of code in the program. I also made sure that I made variables for each value so numbers can be easily changed if needed to adapt to the programmer's/user's wants/needs for the program at hand.
